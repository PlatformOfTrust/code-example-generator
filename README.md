# Code Examples Generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PlatformOfTrust/code-examples-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PlatformOfTrust/code-examples-generator)
[![CHANGELOG.md](https://img.shields.io/badge/-changelog-blue.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)

The purpose of this project is to create a command line tool that is able to 
parse Platform of Trust API documentation and examples from [RAML 1.0](RAML-spec) 
files and generate example HTTP requests in various languages.

For instructions how to use this tool see [USER GUIDE][guide].

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This is a [Clojure][clj] project and requires:

1. [Java 8 or above][jdk]
2. [Leiningen 2.0 or above][lein] (OSX users can use `brew install leiningen`).

You can make sure that everything is installed by running `java --version && lein -v`.

```
$ java --version && lein -v
java 11.0.2 2018-10-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.2+7-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.2+7-LTS, mixed mode)
Leiningen 2.9.1 on Java 11.0.2 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM
```

### Running the application

`lein run` will run the code example generator (and install dependencies). Without 
passing any extra parameters it will display command line help.

```
 $lein run
  -s, --source PATH                    Required RAML file or a directory that contains RAML files.
  -d, --dest PATH      ./pot-examples  Optional Directory for generated code examples.
  -H, --host HOST      pot.org         Required URI host e.g. `pot.org`.
  -S, --scheme SCHEME  https           Optional URI scheme (`https` or `http`).
  -h, --help
  -v, --version
```

See [user guide][guide] for more details how to use it.

## Testing

```
lein test                               # Run unit tests
lein test-refesh                        # Run unit tests automatically when files change
lein cloverage                          # Generate code coverage report
```

NB! This project is expected to have > 50% code coverage for unit tests and it 
has been set as a criteria for successful builds in CI. You can change it in 
[project.clj](project.clj).

```
  :cloverage {:fail-threshold 50
              :low-watermark 70
              :high-watermark 90}
```

<!-- ### Integration tests -->

<!-- This tool will generate HTTP request examples according to provided (HTTP  -->
<!-- request) templates and API documenation in RAML. Unit tests should be  -->
<!-- sufficient to make sure that generate examples have been created correctly but  -->
<!-- they cannot guarantee that requests will actually work in their respetive  -->
<!-- environments due to errors in either documentation or templates. -->

<!-- Integration tests will take the generated HTTP request examples and run them  -->
<!-- against [Mockbin](mockbin) HTTP endpoints to make sure that requests work in  -->
<!-- their respective environments. -->

<!-- TODO! More details about setup and running. -->

<!-- Passing integration tests is a requirement for successful builds in CI! -->

## Deployment

Each commit to master branch will trigger a new build process that will build a 
binary (jar file `raml2http.jar`) that will be uploaded to the assets of 
[latest release][releases-latest]. 

Each tag will create a [release][releases] with tag name and upload jar file 
with version suffix e.g. `raml2http-v1.0.1.jar`.
